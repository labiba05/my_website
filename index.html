     <p> Modesty has catched a lot of indivduals eyes and has inspired many young civillians to get into modest fashion.
         Modest fashion allows young girls to cover up yet still look presentable and still able to follow up trendy fashion outifts.
         in spring and summer it is particualry hard to shop for since you are not able to layer up because of the hot weather. This outfit
         has a nice spring look with it still looking modest.  
     </p>


     <p> To lightly layer up you could start of by wearing a white collard shirt from many different materials to go for, from
         cotton to linen being a breathable material to wear in warm weathers. You could wear this underneath a nice 
         light knitted jumper like shown in the picture above. Already you are wearing a nice breathable outfit for a spring
         weather. Choosing a light colour jumper is nice to wear in spring time because firstly they have the potential to 
         absorb less heat and therfore will keep you cool but light colours also look incredibly nice giving a nice softer and 
         cooler look. </p>

        <p> Now to move onto the bottom half baggy looking jeans is the best way to go. There are many differnt styles of jeans,
            for example in the picture above the jeans she is wearing are called Mum jeans giving a baggy fit, but you could
            also wear wide leg jeans to go for an even more baggier look or could wear long straight leg jeans giving a nice 
            slouchy look. Wearing loose look jeans have many advantages. One benifit of wearing voluminous jeans is that, in warm weathers your jeans wont be sticking to your
            legs making you feel uncomfortable and annoyed, instead you would feel comfy and will also look put together.  </p>

            <h3> Accesories</h3>

            <p> Accesorizing plays a key role from making your outifit go from a 6 to a 10. It makes you look more presentable 
                and adds a lot more to your outfit. Sunglasses are a perfect addition to your outfit, first being extremely useful
                on a sunny day and two making you look elegant. Jewellery is a must, rings, bracelets, necklaces, the whole lot.
                Another must are small cute little handbags to carry. For the summer i would recommend getting bright colours to compliment
                your outfit and make you look more sophisticated.
